    "content": "Sunmarke | Positive Education International School in Dubai A Positive Education School About > A Positive Education School A Positive Education School A Philosophy Where Character Strengths Underpin Academic Excellence Truly outstanding education is not just about academic and personal achievements but also about the development of character, values, and wellbeing. This is the essence of Positive Education (PosEd). A scientifically-proven concept, PosEd is causing a paradigm shift in global education where parents, schools and governments realise the need to increase a child’s ‘wellbeing’ to raise his/her levels of ‘achievement’. PosEd brings together the science of Positive Psychology combined with the best teaching practices to enable individuals, schools, and communities to flourish, be resilient, creative, successful and happy. Sunmarke – A Character-Building School Multiple studies on the effects of PosEd testify that improved levels of a child’s wellbeing are associated with higher levels of academic engagement, social skills, optimism, behaviour, and fewer mental health-related issues. Positive Education – Sunmarke’s DNA Positive Education (PosEd) is not an additional subject at Sunmarke but it’s woven into the fabric of the international school’s culture and is reflected in all its activities and teaching mechanisms. Sunmarke’s teachers undergo an intense training programme before entering the classroom where they learn, live, teach and embed Positive Education. This is what our teachers say about the Positive Education training they receive at Sunmarke: “Where amazing happens. A motto that at first glance just appears to be some words to attract parents to send their children to Sunmarke school, almost like a gimmick. Over the past 3 days for me amazing did happen. The positive education training took me on a journey of self-discovery, showing me that changing my mindset can bring positive outcomes. I realized I have the power to make a difference in people’s lives. This training was the best I’ve ever received from a school, as they genuinely cared about us, ensuring we could apply what we learned in teaching and at home. It was an incredible experience, especially since I used to dislike training due to its lack of usefulness. This was entirely different – truly helpful, purposeful, and enlightening. It taught me to believe in the potential of education to inspire change.” “The breadth of knowledge, evidence-based theories, outstanding coordination and delivery, and just everything about this week was outstanding! I was blown away in every way possible and feel so supported, valued, and appreciated.” The ‘Flourish’ Model The 6 Key Skills Practised and Taught by Sunmarke Teachers for Students to Incorporate in Their Lives SUNMARKE'S WELLBEING & COUNSELLING TEAM Our PosEd and wellbeing approach fosters deep trust in our school community, creating a safe, welcoming and nurturing environment. We embed various initiatives into the daily routines, curriculum and extracurricular activities to establish a personal, social and academic support system each child needs to flourish. Class and Form Tutors, Heads of Year, and Subject teachers support students every day through direct teaching, mentoring, workshops and assemblies. The Counselling Department provides compassionate care for children who may require professional support and or simply a sympathetic listening ear. Students and parents both have access to a School Counsellor. A ‘Wellbeing Champion’ represents the school leadership in our Parent Association and ‘Friends of Sunmarke School’ (FOSS) group while the popular monthly ‘Wellness Wednesday’ event raises awareness among parents about crucial topics like strength-based parenting, raising children in the digital age and health and nutrition.

Children acquire new skills through 7 areas of learning and development. In the initial stages, three Prime Areas are in focus: Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Communication and Language Development. Growing up, the Prime Areas help develop skills in 4 Specific Areas: Literacy Mathematics Understanding of the World Expressive Arts and Design Laying the Foundations for Lifelong Learning in FS1 and FS2 At Sunmarke, our Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), comprising FS1 (Nursery) and FS2 (Reception) , offers a broad, balanced, and enriching curriculum for children aged 3 to 5. Rooted in the British curriculum and recognised as one of Dubai’s leading EYFS providers, our programme nurtures each child’s unique strengths and interests through play-based, inquiry-led learning. A Curriculum Designed Around the Whole Child The EYFS curriculum at FS1 and FS2 is structured around seven key areas of learning and development: Prime Areas (Early Focus): Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Communication and Language These areas are particularly emphasised in FS1 , helping our youngest learners develop the essential foundations of confidence, relationships, movement, and communication. Specific Areas (Building on the Foundations): Literacy Mathematics Understanding the World Expressive Arts and Design As children progress into FS2 , these specific areas become more prominent, supporting emerging literacy and numeracy skills, creative expression, and a growing awareness of the world. Characteristics of Effective Learning Across FS1 and FS2, we recognise that children learn in different ways. The EYFS framework promotes three key learning characteristics: Playing and Exploring: Investigating and experiencing, ‘having a go’ Active Learning: Concentrating, persevering, and celebrating achievement Creating and Thinking Critically: Developing ideas, making connections, and problem-solving These traits guide how learning is planned and delivered across both FS1 and FS2, ensuring that each child’s development is supported in a way that reflects their interests, needs, and learning styles. Learning Through Play and Projects At Sunmarke, we view play as a powerful vehicle for learning in both FS1 and FS2. Our curriculum is intentionally designed to offer rich, purposeful play experiences that allow children to explore, imagine, and make sense of the world in a way that is meaningful to them. In FS1 , children are encouraged to investigate through hands-on exploration, sensory play, and open-ended experiences that develop early communication, social, and physical skills. As they transition into FS2 , children engage in more structured yet still playful learning that builds early literacy and numeracy skills while continuing to promote creativity and curiosity. Our project-based learning approach further enhances engagement. Each term, both FS1 and FS2 children explore exciting, inquiry-led themes such as “I Believe I Can Fly,” “Somewhere Out There,” and “Up, Up and Away.” These projects spark imagination and are shaped by the children’s own interests and questions, creating a deep sense of ownership and wonder. Whether FS1 children are building a fairy tale castle or FS2 pupils are investigating the planets, our environments are carefully curated to provide challenge, joy, and discovery. Through child-initiated and adult-guided activities, children develop critical thinking, collaboration, and communication—the building blocks of future learning. A Holistic and Nurturing Approach At Sunmarke, we believe that every child in FS1 and FS2 is a unique individual. Our holistic approach to early education goes beyond academics to nurture each child’s emotional, social, physical, and intellectual development. We incorporate globally respected early years methodologies including elements of the Reggio Emilia philosophy , Montessori principles , and the Curiosity Approach . This eclectic framework values child-led exploration, independence, and a strong connection to the learning environment—creating rich opportunities for discovery and expression. Our learning spaces are thoughtfully designed to be calm, beautiful, and engaging, reflecting the importance of the environment as the ‘third teacher’. Teachers and support staff observe closely, respond sensitively, and plan responsively to extend learning in authentic, meaningful ways. Strong partnerships with parents, a passionate team of educators, and a shared belief in the limitless potential of every child create a warm, supportive community. In FS1 and FS2, children feel safe, seen, and inspired—laying a confident foundation for their journey through school and life. Characteristics of Effective Learning The characteristics of Effective Learning describe how children learn and respond to teaching in the Foundation Stage, a factor determined by their individual learning characteristic. Three traits of effective teaching and learning identified by the EYFS are: Playing and Exploring: Finding out, discovering, willing to ‘have a go’ and playing with what they know Active Learning: Being involved and concentrating, trying and persevering, taking pleasure from achievements Creating and Thinking Critically: Developing their own ideas, making links and selecting their own ways to complete tasks 7 Curriculum Areas To enhance the learning experience and make it impactful, Sunmarke has selected 7 curriculum areas taught through unique projects and interests, most of which are child-initiated activities that incorporate elements of imagination, investigation and ‘out of the box’ ideas, concepts and solutions. The EYFS curriculum is designed and based on the philosophy of learning through play which enhances critical thinking abilities, fuels risk-taking and creative skills. Examples of topics are ‘I believe I can fly’, ‘Somewhere out there’ and ‘Up up and away.’ The initiative EYFS curriculum is designed and based on the philosophy of learning through play. Our teaching philosophy is designed to treat all children as unique individuals in their own right. Our holistic approach towards education ensures that parents/carers, class teachers, specialist teachers and learning assistants work very effectively together to support our firm belief that ‘every child is unique’. Our maxim is that happy and well-motivated children are good learners. The Foundation Stage is a safe, secure and friendly environment for our youngest children to gain confidence and independence, as they prepare for the next stage of schooling. It is a foundation for future learning. Characteristics of Effective Learning (CoEL) are a revived element in the current Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum (EYFS). CoEL advocates that while planning and guiding children’s activities, practitioners must reflect on the different ways that students learn, and these lessons must be reflected in their practice.",

Blending a range of outstanding Early Years practices from the best international schools, we commit to a child-initiated learning approach and a sophisticated play-based curriculum that enables students to fulfil their unique potential. Sunmarke’s Amazing Philosophy and Journey A- Autonomy: Children are central to everything we do; all projects stem directly from their interests. M – Mindset: In line with Sunmarke’s ‘Positive Education’ ethos, we teach children to have a ‘Growth Mindset’, encouraging endless possibilities. A- Academics: We provide a broad, balanced yet innovative British curriculum based on the Early Years Foundation Stage, building the bedrock for the future. Z -Zest: Happiness is a key agenda at Sunmarke School; we truly believe that if a child is happy and enthusiastic, they learn better. I – Individuality: Our personalised curriculum ensures every child’s individuality is recognised. Strong teacher/pupil relationships allows tutors to identify and cater to a child’s interests, strengths and challenges. N – Nurture: We nurture every child to enable them to grow and reach their fullest potential. G – Grow: Every child that enters EYFS has a special and incredible journey that helps them grow and develop into happy, healthy teens. Learning Through Play Imaginative and creative play is how children learn about the world. During imaginative play, they manipulate materials, express themselves verbally and non-verbally, plan, act, interact, react and try different roles. Learning is most effective when children participate in creative play with dolls, vehicles, blocks, rocks, cardboard, or boxes. Employing creative thinking while manipulating play dough, creating recipes by mixing dirt and water, working with art materials, splashing in puddles, or pretending to fly can further child development. Imagination fosters cognitive and social development by allowing children to contemplate different resolutions, thus boosting their self-confidence. Our Early Years Foundation Stage has been rated as ‘ Outstanding ’ in the latest KHDA’s DSIB inspection report (2023-24) with ‘ Outstanding Personal Development & Learning Skills and Outstanding Curriculum and Curriculum Adaptation’.",

    "content": "Primary Schools - Best Primary School Near You in Dubai Primary Curriculum Learning > Primary > Primary Curriculum Primary School Primary Curriculum A Curriculum Underpinned by our Positive Education Ethos Philosophy At Sunmarke, we firmly believe in equipping our students with the skills they’ll need in the ever-changing landscape of 21st Century thinking and work. We do this by empowering our students through an innovative and character-building education that inspires them to thrive and achieve with purpose. Our curriculum design serves to reflect this. Whilst maintaining academic rigour through the British National Curriculum, our holistic Positive Education ethos and ambitious commitment to innovative technology ensures our children achieve outstanding academic, social and personal success. Additionally, opportunities for Forest School lessons and outdoor learning are provided to all Primary students. Therefore, the drivers for our curriculum are based on two principles: all learning is purposeful with real-life application and context; and students can make connections across interdisciplinary skills. STEAM With the opening of our dedicated STEAM Centre, SPACE-X, and the addition of specialist resident design technology and computing teachers, we have redesigned our curriculum to take us from our thematic roots to design thinking, using the Stanford d.school approach below. Whilst English and maths remain explicitly on the timetable, children work on STEAM theme projects across science, design technology, engineering, the arts, maths and humanities, with the option to also make purposeful links to our UAE moral, social and cultural studies and Values in Action objectives . Living in the UAE, it is vital we also make purposeful links to our local surroundings, Islamic culture and Arabic language. This hands-on approach to problem-solving enables each STEAM theme to culminate in a proposed project which requires the students to design/make/create something which draws upon the knowledge and skills which they have learnt over the course of the project . During each STEAM project , each class will spend two weeks in SPACE-X, where the support of our specialists will enable children’s designs to come to life. Primary Core Subjects Primary Foundation Subjects English History Mathematics Geography STEAM (including science) Modern Foreign languages (MFL): French/Mandarin Arabic Art & Design Islamic Computing Values in Action/moral, social and cultural studies Music Physical Education (including swimming) In addition to the subjects above, Sunmarke offers a diverse range of sports, co-curricular and enrichment activities to supplement the academic programme.",

Seamless Transition Sunmarke Secondary School ensures that students have a smooth transition from Primary to Secondary school to succeed in the next phase of their academic journey. To make the experience less daunting, our staff works closely with families. Our transition programme from Primary to Secondary school ensures that they start Year 7 full of excitement and with minimal nervousness. This section contains important and up-to-date information about our transition programme. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Ms Young (Deputy Head – Student Opportunity) or Mr Matthews (Head of Year 7). Transitioning Into Secondary We strive to do our utmost to ensure that the transition from Year 6 to Year 7 is as smooth and welcoming as possible. Days for Your Diary Upcoming activities: Secondary pastoral leaders visit Year 6 children in their classrooms to hold informal Q&A sessions. Parent Coffee Mornings are held in Term Two and Three to learn more about the Secondary School and how to support your children with the transition process. This is an opportunity to meet key members of staff such as the Secondary Leadership Team. During the summer term, children will have the opportunity to experience Secondary Taster lessons. This will give them the chance to meet some of our secondary school staff and experience this part of the school building. More information and timings for the above events will be available soon via VLE. Approach To Learning In Secondary Our approach encourages students to build the skills and learning habits to become independent thinkers – preparing them for life way beyond Year 13. Thinking Skills At Sunmarke through our ‘Positive Education’ inclusive approach, students are enabled to flourish in a safe, happy and nurturing learning environment. They are stretched and challenged to ask and develop their own questions to harness their potential to the maximum. Opportunities are provided through numerous activities undertaken in the classroom, on the sports field, on stage, through educational visits abroad, organising charity events, or representing the school as outstanding ambassadors. Leadership There are numerous opportunities for leadership from informal roles within the classroom to formal roles outside of the classroom e.g. Prefects, School and Community Ambassadors. Students can aspire to leadership roles within and outside their year groups. These roles are designed to promote excellence while enabling student leaders to play a role in the development of the school and community. The Student Hub within the Secondary School is a dedicated space for secondary students to meet with their Student Leadership Team. At Sunmarke we believe in student voice and the sharing of ideas. The Hub provides a platform for every student to be heard and to interact with their Student Leaders. Digital Learning Sunmarke students are adept at using technology through class assignment and quizzes, home learning, submission and assessments, online collaboration and communication between students and teachers, tracking progress and behaviour and access to school resources, library books and information. We promote and sustain a culture that encourages the integration of digital technologies into all areas of the curriculum. Students engage and collaborate with their peers using a variety of digital environments and tools. Cyber-safety is an integral part of how the school community works with everyone being aware of their digital responsibilities, modelling ethical and appropriate use of digital resources. Please view our Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) here . Social Responsibility Our principled, creative and innovative learning environment encourages students to have a responsibility ‘for’ and ‘towards’ the community. They learn to be solution-focused, discuss controversial topics, share their opinions on what they learn, ask questions and engage in dialogue. Environment and Sustainability Sustainability is a key agenda at Sunmarke School. We believe that we have a shared responsibility as citizens of the world to choose sustainable practices and we empower our students to do the same. Below are just some of the ways we incorporate the environment and sustainability within our subjects. Media – Sunmarke’s Media students focus on projects related to sustainable transportation, the effects of pollution and draw upon the beauty of nature and landscapes when building their portfolios. Economics – Our Business and Economics courses cover topics such as economic growth vs development, effects of trade and globalisation, the impact of deforestation etc. Students are encouraged to research policies to solve urgent environmental issues. The Sciences – A Level and IB Biology – Both courses include the study of ecosystems, ecology and biodiversity. Secondary students also look into the sustainability of using earth’s resources and assess the impact of extracting, using and recycling. Global Outlook Our excellent, holistic education and team of dedicated teachers place values like honesty, responsibility, tolerance and respect for the rights of others irrespective of nationality, gender, culture or religion at the foundation of learning. This provides students the skills and knowledge to meet the challenges of the future. Our high-quality education and multi-pathway model with bespoke career paths guide them to find the most appropriate route to study their favourite subjects at the university of their choice.",

Seamless Transition Sunmarke Secondary School ensures that students have a smooth transition from Primary to Secondary school to succeed in the next phase of their academic journey. To make the experience less daunting, our staff works closely with families. Our transition programme from Primary to Secondary school ensures that they start Year 7 full of excitement and with minimal nervousness. This section contains important and up-to-date information about our transition programme. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Ms Young (Deputy Head – Student Opportunity) or Mr Matthews (Head of Year 7). Transitioning Into Secondary We strive to do our utmost to ensure that the transition from Year 6 to Year 7 is as smooth and welcoming as possible. Days for Your Diary Upcoming activities: Secondary pastoral leaders visit Year 6 children in their classrooms to hold informal Q&A sessions. Parent Coffee Mornings are held in Term Two and Three to learn more about the Secondary School and how to support your children with the transition process. This is an opportunity to meet key members of staff such as the Secondary Leadership Team. During the summer term, children will have the opportunity to experience Secondary Taster lessons. This will give them the chance to meet some of our secondary school staff and experience this part of the school building. More information and timings for the above events will be available soon via VLE. Approach To Learning In Secondary Our approach encourages students to build the skills and learning habits to become independent thinkers – preparing them for life way beyond Year 13. Thinking Skills At Sunmarke through our ‘Positive Education’ inclusive approach, students are enabled to flourish in a safe, happy and nurturing learning environment. They are stretched and challenged to ask and develop their own questions to harness their potential to the maximum. Opportunities are provided through numerous activities undertaken in the classroom, on the sports field, on stage, through educational visits abroad, organising charity events, or representing the school as outstanding ambassadors. Leadership There are numerous opportunities for leadership from informal roles within the classroom to formal roles outside of the classroom e.g. Prefects, School and Community Ambassadors. Students can aspire to leadership roles within and outside their year groups. These roles are designed to promote excellence while enabling student leaders to play a role in the development of the school and community. The Student Hub within the Secondary School is a dedicated space for secondary students to meet with their Student Leadership Team. At Sunmarke we believe in student voice and the sharing of ideas. The Hub provides a platform for every student to be heard and to interact with their Student Leaders. Digital Learning Sunmarke students are adept at using technology through class assignment and quizzes, home learning, submission and assessments, online collaboration and communication between students and teachers, tracking progress and behaviour and access to school resources, library books and information. We promote and sustain a culture that encourages the integration of digital technologies into all areas of the curriculum. Students engage and collaborate with their peers using a variety of digital environments and tools. Cyber-safety is an integral part of how the school community works with everyone being aware of their digital responsibilities, modelling ethical and appropriate use of digital resources. Please view our Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) here . Social Responsibility Our principled, creative and innovative learning environment encourages students to have a responsibility ‘for’ and ‘towards’ the community. They learn to be solution-focused, discuss controversial topics, share their opinions on what they learn, ask questions and engage in dialogue. Environment and Sustainability Sustainability is a key agenda at Sunmarke School. We believe that we have a shared responsibility as citizens of the world to choose sustainable practices and we empower our students to do the same. Below are just some of the ways we incorporate the environment and sustainability within our subjects. Media – Sunmarke’s Media students focus on projects related to sustainable transportation, the effects of pollution and draw upon the beauty of nature and landscapes when building their portfolios. Economics – Our Business and Economics courses cover topics such as economic growth vs development, effects of trade and globalisation, the impact of deforestation etc. Students are encouraged to research policies to solve urgent environmental issues. The Sciences – A Level and IB Biology – Both courses include the study of ecosystems, ecology and biodiversity. Secondary students also look into the sustainability of using earth’s resources and assess the impact of extracting, using and recycling. Global Outlook Our excellent, holistic education and team of dedicated teachers place values like honesty, responsibility, tolerance and respect for the rights of others irrespective of nationality, gender, culture or religion at the foundation of learning. This provides students the skills and knowledge to meet the challenges of the future. Our high-quality education and multi-pathway model with bespoke career paths guide them to find the most appropriate route to study their favourite subjects at the university of their choice.",

    "content": "Secondary Schools - Best Senior Secondary School in Dubai Near You Secondary Curriculum Learning > Secondary > Secondary Curriculum Secondary School Secondary Curriculum Subject Offerings Rooted in STEAM ( Science, Technology, Engineering, Art & Mathematics) and Creative Learning Our innovative curriculum prepares students to make the right choices in Year 10. As an inclusive school, Sunmarke offers a wide range of options at Key Stage 4. Through offering GCSE, IGCSE, and BTEC courses, we are able to accommodate a wide range of learning styles, whilst ensuring the level of challenge is such that all post-16 pathways remain open to students. GCSE examinations are the mainstay of an English education, with most students following this pathway. At Sunmarke we also offer IGCSE examinations; the ‘I’ stands for international and means the course has been adapted to suit a more international student body. The difficulty level of GCSE and IGCSE exams are the same, but the content of GCSE examinations is more English-centred. A good example of this would be in Business Studies where the case studies for a GCSE would be UK companies, which many of our students would not have heard of. This is why we follow the IGCSE pathway for Business Studies, meaning the case studies focus on large multi-national companies all our students would know. BTEC courses are as challenging as GCSE course but are assessed in a different manner. All BTEC courses are coursework based, with students undertaking assessed units every 12 weeks or so, these are all graded, and the outcome is the sum of these assessments. BTEC courses suit students who prefer to ‘chunk’ their assessments rather than taking one or two summative exams at the end of the course which determine their final outcome. Compulsory subjects and options choices All students study the core subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, Arabic, Games and Moral, Social Cultural Studies. In addition to these core subjects, students also select four additional subjects from our extensive list of optional subjects. Each of these subjects is listed below with a brief outline of the course content and the method of assessment.

Sunmarke Shorts VLOG The Media and Communication focus is interesting as it allows interested students to join Sunmarke’s editorial team where they become student reporters, producing an online and physical newspaper, podcasts and blogs. These fun activities enhance their presentation, collaboration, and communication skills. Sunmarke offers students plenty of opportunities to tap into their creative side. Take a deeper look at our Creative Arts subjects below: Art Our Arts Department allows students to experiment in different disciplines such as fine art, digital art, textiles, sculpting, pottery and print-making. We have some outstanding wall art murals that Primary and Secondary school students collaborate on around the school. Music Sunmarke benefits from the Fortes’ VIP Academy for Performing Arts and a team of professional music teachers who train students in varied musical instruments and skills. All students are encouraged to develop an appreciation of music. Every student learns an instrument of his or her choice and many develop mastery and choose to prepare for the Trinity/ABRSM music exams. Talented students are nurtured to consider music as a choice of higher study, while some choose to just have fun jamming in a band. Also, keep an eye out for the ‘ Lunchtime Pop-Up Series ‘ where our hottest musicians perform around school and delight all with their musical talents. Drama With inspirational drama and music teachers and an Auditorium, Black Box studio and several studios for the Performing Arts, Sunmarke provides students ample opportunities to contribute to various aspects of a theatrical production as performers or crew. Some of our most recent productions include We Will Rock You, Little Shop of Horrors, and The Wiz . Our Drama students also regularly enact plays and skits and participate in inter-school competitions.",

Sunmarke also offers The Duke of Edinburgh International Award (DofE International Award) which enriches our students’ lives with practical experiences, life skills and allows them to discover their hidden talents and capabilities. The Duke Of Edinburgh Award The Duke of Edinburgh International Award, founded in 1956 by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh is the world’s leading youth achievement award, bringing together experiences and life skills to equip young people for life. The concept of the Award is of individual challenge designed to encourage young people between 14 and 25 to develop into responsible, active citizens who will contribute towards society. What’s involved? The Award is voluntary, non-competitive, enjoyable and balanced, and requires students to expend effort over a period of time. There are three levels to the Award: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Young people design their own Award programme, set their own goals and record their own progress. They can choose four categories: Service, Physical Recreation or a Skills activity, or go on an Expedition. Here are some more details of each segment. Service The Award gives students the opportunity to give back to the community and make a real difference to the people or wildlife/animals, or to contribute to a good cause. It acquaints students with the joy of giving. Examples include: first aid, visiting and supporting people in need, volunteering at hospitals, sports coaching, charity work, etc. Physical Recreation Physical Recreation, both individually and within a team, is a fun and healthy way of developing a real sense of achievement outside the classroom, instilling enthusiasm and feeling of wellbeing. Examples include: Ball Sports, Athletics, Water Sports, Winter Sports, Martial Arts, Animal Sports, etc. Skill The Award encourages students to learn something new as a part of the process. Whether their interests lie in skiing or photography, the Award allows them to explore their passions. Examples include: Music, Arts and Crafts, Nature and the Environment, Communication, Games and Sports and related skills, etc. The Adventurous Journey The Adventurous Journey section is about undertaking a team journey or expedition. Participants plan, train for and undertake a journey with a purpose in an unfamiliar environment. Students spend 2 days and 1 night away completing around 12 hours of purposeful effort in total.

Leadership All students at Sunmarke’s Sixth Form are leaders and role models and they embrace this responsibility fully. These young leaders play a crucial role in the growth of the school and the community. Within their academics, students are provided options to lead their own learning such as through the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), available to A Level and BTEC students or through various pieces of coursework, such as the Extended Essay and Reflective Project on the International Baccalaureate pathways.

    "content": "A-Levels Sixth Form Schools in Dubai | Sunmarke School Dubai A-Levels Learning > Sixth Form > A-Levels A-Levels An Internationally Recognised Qualification Focusing On Content-Driven Academic Subjects Why study A-Levels? Advanced Level qualifications (known as A-Levels) are individual subject based qualifications. They are one option available to students who are looking to study at university. With A-Levels being standalone qualifications, there is no requirement on subject combinations and students’ only constraint is the combinations available within the school timetable. A-Levels are graded from A*-E. What does this Pathway look like? Students will usually take 3 or 4 A-Levels and this would be what universities would be looking for as offers are based mainly on 3 A-Level grades. If you are debating which subjects to choose, we recommend you start with 4 A-Levels so you can have a range to begin with which you can narrow down later. Students will receive 6 lessons per subject each week with most subjects being 100% examination-based. Subjects either fit into the category of modular A-Levels or linear A-Levels. In modular subjects, students will take up to three exams in Year 12 and up to three in Year 13 whereas, with linear A-Levels, students complete all exams at the end of Year 13. How does this Pathway lead to University? A-Levels are internationally recognised qualifications which will give you access to the most competitive universities worldwide. While taking A-Levels would give you the necessary prerequisites with regards to subjects, you may need to take further tests in English in order to study at universities where courses are delivered in English. In addition, students wishing to study certain subjects worldwide need to review the Mathematics requirements for entry into the university of their choice. What skills will I develop? Taking a combination of A-Levels will allow you to specialise in a particular area post 16 as opposed to waiting until you begin university. With few subjects having coursework components, there is a lot of focus on exam skills. However, there is the option of taking the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) in order to develop your academic writing and research skills. Furthermore, the EPQ is a perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate and develop your interest in an area you want to go on to study at university; competitive universities are always looking for examples of students pursuing their academic passions outside of the classroom. Whether it be the other EPQ or another opportunity, we recommend you find an outlet to explore your passions through extra-curricular activities.",

    "content": "BTEC Programme - Business and Technology Education Council, Sunmarke BTECs Learning > Sixth Form > BTECs BTECs A Dynamic BTEC Programme Helping Students Develop Vocational Skills To Move To University Or Into Direct Employment What are BTECs? Short for Business and Technology Education Council, BTECs are a practical-based, vocational qualification which offers the same equivalence to A-Levels when converted into UCAS points. Many industry sectors have a set of National Occupational Standards that professionals must follow. The learning content of BTECs is built around these National Occupational Standards, which is why BTECs are recognised as valuable qualifications. They provide the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a field or subject and are an excellent alternative to the more theory focused A-Levels or subjects on the IB Diploma Programme. What does this Pathway look like? BTECs are taught through application with students often going on educational visits and meeting industry specialists as well as completing one week of work experience in Year 12. Assessments are via regular coursework and projects throughout the 2-year course. If you know you don’t excel in exam conditions, BTECs can relieve this pressure, spreading out the work that dictates your final grade as 100% of your final grade will come from these coursework components. Students are able to take a combination of BTECs and A-Levels in order to have a balance between hands on learning whilst also taking more traditional subjects. How does this Pathway lead to University? BTECs are equivalent to A-Levels in terms of applications to universities. However, there are some universities which don’t accept these qualifications so you would need to research the different countries you would like to apply for in order to ensure you meet the admissions criteria for your desired destination. What skills will I develop? BTECs truly prepare students for the real world, offering them practical skills to be successful in the industry of their choosing. If you enjoy practical learning and want to study a specialised range of subjects, BTECs are the perfect option for you. Within each subject, more technical skills are developed; for example, we are very proud of our BTEC Media courses that allow students to create using hi-tech equipment as students learn how to get the most out of this technology.",

Find out more about the details of the IB Diploma Programme at Sunmarke. What is the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme? The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is a holistic programme which gives you a broad post 16 education whilst also allowing you to specialise in three subjects. You will take three Standard Level subjects and three Higher Level subjects as well as the Extended Essay, Theory of Knowledge and the Creativity, Activity and Service Programme (CAS). Each subject is graded from 1-7 with the diploma core (Theory of Knowledge and Extended Essay) giving 3 more points depending on the combination of grades in these components. Students must achieve a minimum total of 24 points to pass the Diploma Programme. What does this Pathway look like? Each week you will receive lessons in your 6 subjects (typically 4 lessons for higher level and 3 for standard level) as well as lessons in Theory of Knowledge (TOK). You will also receive sessions to develop writing and research skills needed for the Extended Essay. This is a piece of academic writing where you choose the subject, topic and research question to produce an answer in a 4,000 word research report. The CAS programme is a non-graded component which encourages students to set objectives in creative, active and service experiences outside of the classroom. Each subject has a coursework component worth at least 20% meaning the whole grade does not rest on the final exams. How does this Pathway lead to University? An internationally recognised qualification, the IBDP will give you access to the most competitive universities worldwide. With the DP developing more than just subject knowledge, universities see it as a perfect higher education preparation programme. As all students study English Language and Literature, you will meet the language requirement of most universities that deliver courses in English. The IBDP programme also continues a student’s study in Mathematics. Students completing the IBDP programme continue to study Mathematics and English throughout their Secondary education and are then able to demonstrate 4 years of study in Mathematics and English during the application process. The IB Diploma, due to its holistic nature and its requirements, is highly valued by universities worldwide. What skills will I develop? Through coursework components, the Extended Essay and Theory of Knowledge, you will learn to think critically, write well constructed, balanced arguments and write using an academic structure. The CAS programme develops skills to ensure you are a well-rounded student who has lots of experiences beyond the classroom to make you really stand out in university applications and interviews.

The IB Learner Profile is a set of traits which the IB believes students must develop to meet the mission’s long-term goal. Throughout the two years of the programme, teachers will promote these attributes in lessons to help students become better learners which will enhance their academic journey and prepare them to be more independent after graduating from school. Below are the 10 traits that make up the IB Learner Profile.",

Careers lessons in Y12 focus on psychometric testing, university and career research and to start working on application requirements such as personal statements and US university essays. We encourage all families to explore this platform together as early as possible in order to start the conversation as to where a student may study as well as what the course requirements are in order to make sure the right combination of subjects are being chosen post 16. There are many factors that go into shortlisting universities such as location, size, tuition fees or university housing to name just a few; with all this choice, it is important to narrow down to specific countries in Year 12 so the application process is not overwhelming in Year 13. Students work one-on-one with the university careers counsellors who assist and guide students through every step of the application process. University Destinations Sunmarke students achieve their first choice university destinations which has included UK Russel Group schools, and top Worldwide destinations such as the Imperial College London, NYU, University of Amsterdam, Bocconi, Carnegie Mellon, UCLA, UC San Diego, Georgia Tech, The University of Toronto, McGill and University of Edinburgh. For a full list of our destinations, click here . Offline University Guidance Parents are invited to join our ‘SunRise Sessions’ where they learn about different aspects of applying to universities around the world and get informed about the procedures and pathways. Our tailored programme of learning includes researching courses, writing personal statements, practising for aptitude tests and interviews, holding mock interviews and completing applications. We also host admissions teams from leading universities from around the world each year, giving students a unique opportunity to find out more about their courses and expectations.

As a result, the careers guidance has a whole-school remit designed to complement the rest of the school curriculum. This policy sets out how career activities are delivered at school and what stakeholders can expect. Aims and Objectives The careers guidance aims to: Encourage students to be ambitious, broaden their horizons and explore their own aspirations throughout their life at school Ensure students’ readiness to take their next step in their learning or career Help students to understand the changing world of work Facilitate meaningful encounters with potential employers Support positive transitions Post-16 and Post-18 Enable students to develop research skills Help them to develop the skills, attitudes and qualities to make a successful transition into the world of work Encourage participation in continued learning, including further and higher education Support inclusion, challenging stereotyping and promoting equality of opportunity Contribute to strategies for raising achievement, particularly by increasing motivation",

According to the MOE resolution, he can enrol in FS2 next academic year only if he completes FS1 this academic year. 8. My daughter will be 4 years old in December. If I enrol her in FS2 for the last term of this year – before the changes come into effect – will she be able to start Year 1 next year? Yes. The new age requirements will apply for new students from the start of the next academic year only. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. 9.
